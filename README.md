# SimpleProductivityMonitor

This is a Python based window tracking activity monitor which uses Activity Watch's window event tracking data and an Anvil user interface.

In order to use this, you must:

1. Download and install Activity Watch https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch
2. Additionally install Activity Watch's Chrome extension.
3. Then run Activity Watch to gather data, and make sure it's running while you're using the application
4. When you want to see visualizations of your activity data, run 'monitor.py', first with 'init' as a command line arg. Allow this to run as long as you're using the interface
5. Then copy paste this Anvil link https://NEFSIWS76ODZ7GUB.anvil.app/DQRH47ZX4WBWWJ3FBKWKMAJM to access the interface
